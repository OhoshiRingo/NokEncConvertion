It may also support Japanese sentences or writing, as well as several languages.
Maybe this can be used because first I encode it to Base64 then convert it again to Morse or whatever.
But the feature next to it will definitely issue an error because it doesn't support the symbols or letters that have been specified in the Array.

Of course I didn't install a send logger for me. If you are in doubt you can check the source of my code.
